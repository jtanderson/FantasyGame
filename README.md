# FantasyGame

A demo text-based adventure game primarily to demonstrate advantages of inheritence and polymorphism

Done:
  - [x] GameState pushdown-machine structure
  - [x] TravelingState (keep walking, stop and rest, take forks)
  - [x] Random road forks

  - [x] Allow handlers to take player entity arg

Todo:

  - [ ] More idle actions
  - [ ] Character entities
  - [ ] Simple item/eqipment entities
  - [ ] Random text/description generation engine
